# HP-Protein-Folding

Deep RL Algorithms for the HP Protein Folding problem.

seqs.txt is a list of protein sequences with length less than or equal to 100. 

lattice2d_linear_env.py and lattice2d_cnn_env.py are gym environments for linear models and cnn models, respectively.

The other ipynb notebooks are the different algorithms used.

HP2D_Env.py, MCTS.py, and models.py are the docs used for the AlphaZero Algo
